        <p>I‚Äôve managed to finish migrating all of my VMs to the new DL380 G7 ESXi Host. Afterwards, I found some time to sit down and draw a quick network diagram. I then posted this diagram to an online forum and received some good questions &amp; suggestions.</p>

<h3 id="suggestions-received">Suggestions Received</h3>
<ol>
<li>Move the Xbox and Media PC off of the main network‚Äôs subnet as if the HTPC is running many 3rd party programs, which it is, it may be considered untrusted.</li>
</ol>
<p>I like this suggestion, and I‚Äôve actually implemented the changes into my current environment!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use vlans! Why aren‚Äôt you using vlans?</li>
</ol>
<p>I haven‚Äôt found a use case for vlans in my current environment yet. I have some experience with using them in the past, so incorporating them into my lab would be a beneficial learning experience.</p>

<h3 id="questions-people-asked">Questions People Asked</h3>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs your thought process on subnetting?</strong><br>
The reason I have a 10.0.0.x network and a 192.168.1.x network is because I want my VM lab to have nothing to do with the rest of my network. It‚Äôs for testing stuff mostly, so I didn‚Äôt want to confuse myself .</p>
<p><strong>What are your projects/plans for all of that RAM?</strong><br>
I want to get to a point where I‚Äôm emulating my work‚Äôs environment, they have a few more servers there so I‚Äôll need the ram to be able to mimic it all on one machine. That and I run my own VMs for home.</p>
<p><strong>Why the switches instead of PFsense vlans?</strong><br>
pfSense is only 3 days old, I haven‚Äôt had the chance to use it. I&rsquo;ll be adding vlans to the list of things I test before using it as my main firewall/router. (Lots of people suggested vlans!)</p>
<p><strong>Whats your end goal/learning objective?</strong><br>
Kinda mentioned in Q2. I want to replicate my work‚Äôs environment so I can become more familiar with networking and the likes. I‚Äôm a year into working in IT as a qualified professional and just want to be able to test stuff in my own environment without the risk of destroying my career with the press of a button.</p>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs running on the TX1330?</strong><br>
It was my first server, so it was my ESXi host running everything. (I also had a 1050 Ti in there for GPU passthrough to one of the VMs)
Currently it‚Äôs just a datastore but I‚Äôm looking to turn it into either a NAS or even just a windows server with a bunch of shares. I need to figure out the pros and cons of each before I do.
I‚Äôm glad someone asked about it since it is by far my favourite server. Only pulls 50W when idling so it‚Äôs cheap as chips to run. (That‚Äôs how I justified the cost).</p>
